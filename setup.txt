Setup guide:

If you haven't already, first clone the repo with the command:
git clone https://git.cardiff.ac.uk/c1946278/informatics-team-13.git

Now do these:
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
set FLASK_APP=wsgi
set FLASK_DEBUG=True

Now everything is setup. Whenever you want to run the flask server, do this (make sure you're in (venv) mode):
flask run
